# RelFinder for SNIK

[RelFinder](http://www.visualdataweb.org/relfinder.php) [integration](http://www.visualdataweb.org/integrating.php) with the [SNIK](http://www.snik.eu) [Ontology](http://www.snik.eu/ontology).

## Deprecation
RelFinder needs Adobe Flash to run because it is based on Adobe Flex.
We configured RelFinder for the SNIK ontology and hosted a copy here but we don't maintain the copy anymore. Due to security and stability issues, we don't recommend you to get flash just for RelFinder.

## Usage

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Execute `init` (Linux or macOS) or [download RelFinder.swf manually](https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/RelFinder/blob/master/bin/RelFinder.swf) (other operating systems).
